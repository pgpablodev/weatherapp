# WeatherApp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General overview

This web app is capable of giving the user a 5-day forecast of the place they're living in, through a nice, user-friendly interface which is responsive so that this app can be visited from different devices without any problem. A map is also shown in the desktop version of the app.

## Used technologies

The app mainly consists in a React app, which uses axios to make a request to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), whose team I thank a lot for having made this possible. Leaflet is also used to render the map, for which I thank [OpenStreetMap](https://osm.org/copyright). Of course HTML5 and CSS3 give shape to the app.
